This is a pre-interview task assigned to me by a company and  by the way this was my first project .And i have done it mostly by using front-end technologies .The main Aim of the project was to build an lighter version of food delivery web application similiar to Zomato and did it based on whatever skills that i possesed ath that time .To be honest with you guys i was not selected after doing this project (LOL).
